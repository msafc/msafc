Hi there 👋🏻 

My name is Meritxell and I am a junior web developer.

I'm going to start my internship this March and will be learning as much as I can. 
Due to my artistical background I feel I can bring to the table a more creative problem solving approach to the projects. 

Here you can find my very first projects on programming I've made during the programming course along with others I've done on my own spare time. 
If you have some questions or want to know more about a project don't hesitate to contact me.

Thanks for reading!
